  abstract = {Education is crucial for the development of any country. Analysis of education datasets requires effective algorithms to extract hidden information and gain the fruitful results to improve academic performance. Multiple models were used to maximize the contribution to the education environment. In this study, we used the spot-checking algorithm to compare these methods and find the most effective method. We propose three main classes of education research tools: a statistical analysis method, ma...},
