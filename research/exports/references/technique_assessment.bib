  abstract = {The Colebrook equation is a popular model for estimating friction loss coefficients in water and gas pipes. The model is implicit in the unknown flow friction factor, f . To date, the captured flow friction factor, f , can be extracted from the logarithmic form analytically only in the term of the Lambert W -function. The purpose of this study is to find an accurate and computationally efficient solution based on the shifted Lambert W -function also known as the Wright ω-function. The Wright ω-f...},

The algorithm is a two-timescale method that uses a variant of Q-learning on the finer timescal...},
