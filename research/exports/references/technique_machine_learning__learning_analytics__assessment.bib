  abstract = {This paper examines the use of Educational Data Mining (EDM) to predict the academic performance of elementary students specifically in Mathematics. It explores ten Machine Learning classifiers, comprising eight base learners (Linear SVM, Logistic Regression, Medium KNN, Wide NN, Fine Decision Trees, Bilayered NN, Fine KNN, and Medium NN) as well as two ensemble learners (Ensemble Subspace Discriminant and Ensemble Boosted Trees) within the MATLAB environment. The analysis utilizes a dataset fea...},
