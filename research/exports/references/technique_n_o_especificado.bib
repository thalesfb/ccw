The aim is to minimize the makespan, total completion time, total weight completion time, and maximum lateness under an uncertain environment. To address the problem in an uncertain environment, the expected value model and pessimistic value model are developed. These models can be converted...},

This paper proposes a user-centered design framework for the smart aesthetic education teaching platform in response to the needs of aesthetic education.

Performance among pupils attending private secondary schools is superior. However, this raw difference ignores the highly socially selective nature of the English private school system. Adjusting for socioeconomi...},
