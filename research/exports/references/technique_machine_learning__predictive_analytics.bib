  abstract = {The machine learning (ML) called predictive analytics has become a useful tool in computer mathematics. It lets you make models that can predict what will happen in the future based on data from the past. This paper looks at several machine learning (ML) methods used in predictive analytics within the field of computational mathematics. It focuses on how they work, what they can be used for, and how well they work. We look at regression analysis, neural networks, decision trees, support vector m...},

  abstract = {The aim of this quantitative research is to analyze the impact of Facebook in the teaching-learning process in financial mathematics education, using data science, machine learning, and neural networks. The sample is composed of 46 students from the Bachelor of Administration, Commerce and Marketing program at La Salle University. The results of machine learning (linear regression) indicate that sending messages, watching instructional videos, and publishing exercises on Facebook supports the te...},
